# Traveling Salesperson Game

An interactive web game to explore the famous Traveling Salesperson Problem (TSP).

## About the Game

This game allows you to try solving one of computer science's most famous NP-hard problems: finding the shortest possible route that visits a set of cities exactly once and returns to the origin city.

Features:
- Multiple difficulty levels (10 to 40 cities)
- Custom city count option
- Interactive city selection
- Built-in algorithms for comparison:
  - Nearest Neighbor heuristic
  - 2-Opt local optimization
- Track your best solutions

## How to Play

1. Click on cities in order to create a path
2. Try to find the shortest possible route that visits all cities
3. Compare your solution to algorithm-generated paths
4. Challenge yourself with more cities as you improve!

## Why TSP Matters

The Traveling Salesperson Problem has applications in:
- Logistics and route planning
- Circuit board drilling
- DNA sequencing
- Many other optimization problems

It's also a classic example of NP-hard problems in computer
